Daniel took me to the bank of my choice to open an account and he collected me in the mornings and took me to the office and he even took me to look at furniture and TV's etc and all in his own time. Thanks to him I have managed to furnish my apartment the day after the puchase went though.</p>  <p>The service was absolutely first class and I hope you add this to your testimonial page.</p>  <p>Once again, a big thank you and I will be passing your details on to anyone I meet in Los Cristianos who is looking to buy property in Tenerife.</p>    <p>Kind regards,</p>    <p>Bruce Cowie</p>							</div>

There is a constant supply of paragliders coming off the mountain to entertain you.</p>   <p>The apartment is well-equipped with a dishwasher, washing machine, drier, and everything you need in the kitchen. The wifi has always worked well for us. </p>   <p>La Caleta has an amazing collection of outstanding restaurants – you can eat at a different place every day and have a great meal every time. </p>   <p>There are nice walks along the sea front – you can go all the way to Adeje on foot.</p>							</div>

                                Lupain Estate Agents for making the purchase of our apartment in El Mirador -
                                Los Cristianos, so stress free. The process was simple from the point of
                                putting in an offer to completing signing at the Notary and moving in. Special
                                thanks go to Marco for quickly understanding our requirements and finding us
                                the right apartment quickly, not easy because we have a small pet dog. Also
                                special thanks to Eirlys and her replacement, Cecile, for communicating
                                throughout and making the completion process  smooth and understandable.
                                Not easy when so much has to be done on one day from getting your NIE, visiting
                                the bank and signing at the notary. I particularly want to point out the post
                                completion service that Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents offer as its much more than the
                                estate agents in the UK provide. Lupain sign over the electric/water, establish
                                the community payments, point you in the right direction for setting up wifi
                                etc. Nothing went wrong and all was completed with a smile. This is really
                                appreciated if it´s your first purchase in Tenerife which it was for us.</p>							</div>

                            Having recently purchased a holiday property in Tenerife, I was impressed with the service provided by Lupain Estate Agents and have no hesitate in recommending them to any potential buyer. As we have no experience of acquiring property abroad and feet rather daunted by the combination of foreign language &amp; different legal jurisdiction and working practice never mind the cultural differences. I can only admire the professionalism way shown by their staff. The ability to really listen and act on the clients issues and concerns, be pro-active and definitely go the" extra mile" were characteristics displayed by both Eirlys and Chris that I highly valued and it felt like a true personal bispoke service. I would have been completely lost without them. Many thanks Brent							</div>

Although the property we wanted to view had just been sold we were shown 4 others within our preferred location and price range. Victor was very helpful and professional. Not once did we feel like he was trying the "hard sell" routine. During the negotiation process he worked hard to get a price both ourselves and the vendor were happy with. The whole procedure from acceptance to completion went smoothly and took approximately 4.5 weeks							</div>

                            While buying a property in a non-English speaking country would normally be a daunting prospect, Lupain estate agents make the whole process very easy and stress free. A combination of professionalism and individual attention from the Lupain staff make me feel like I was a valued customer and that they were a company I could trust. Victor was especially helpful when I created a problem by agreeing to purchase a property and then changing my mind and deciding to buy another property instead. I would also single out Joyce for her invaluable advice on what and what not to look for in a property, her knowledge of Tenerife and of the whole process of purchasing a property. Not to mention all the driving she did for me and the many cappuccino's she bought me.

                            Dear Victor, Further to completion of the apartment in Los Cristianos, I just wanted to send you a quick review to thank you for all your hard work in bringing the sale to completion. It was at times a rather drawn out process with the parties, solicitors, the property owner and the managing agents spread throughout the country. You provided an invaluable service in bringing the various components of the sale together and I do not believe that, without your expertise on board, the sale would have reached a successful conclusion. I will of course recommend both Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents and you personally to anyone looking to buy or sell property in the area, and you will be my first port of call if/when I return to Tenerife. Thanks again for your help.							</div>

                            We have just purchased a property in Los Cristianos using the services of Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents. We originally contacted Alexander Gil at Lupain who was very helpful, he guided us through the buying process and assisted us with gaining a mortgage through a local bank. On our visit to Los Cristianos to look at property Alexander had lined up a number of properties for us to view, they were all in line with our original requirements including price range. We ended up getting more for our money than we had expected. Alex and Peter Thompson at Lupain assisted us with the negotiation on the price which we agreed. They also took us to the bank and introduced us to the Bank Official looking after our mortgage where we opened an account. We were not able to remain in Tenerife for the duration of the sale, therefore it was necessary to arrange a power of attorney to complete the sale. This was also provided by Eirlys Lloyd of Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents. Our sale went through very efficiently thanks to the hard work of the team at Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents. We would recommend Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents to anybody wishing to purchase property in Tenerife especially if it is your first time.							</div>

We also recommended our friends to buy an apartment from them which they did, and like us they were over the moon with the first class professional service.

                                wife and I decided that we wanted buy a property in Tenerife for a bit of
                                winter sunshine, anywhere from Los Cristianos to Playa Fanabe as long as it was
                                below the motorway. I contacted a few estate agents in Tenerife and the most
                                responsive was Peter Thompson from Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents. After sending a few
                                emails back and forward Peter managed to arrange some viewings in our chosen
                                areas for the dates we were in Tenerife. We met at the Lupain office in Los
                                Cristianos and was warmly greeted by Peter. After a few pleasantries he took us
                                to the onsite café and bought us a coffee each whilst we waited for Victor also
                                from Lupain to meet with us. Victor is the owner of Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents and he
                                quickly put us at ease with the way he had organised our day with various
                                viewings. We set off in Victors car and we visited apartments in Playa des
                                Americas, San Eugenio and Los Cristianos. Victor was very patient with us when
                                we were weighing up the pros and cons of the various properties we had visited.
                                Victor also shared his knowledge of Tenerife often giving us a valuable insite
                                into the areas we were looking around. When we finally settled on a property
                                Victor and his staff took us through the process from start to finish even
                                including one of his staff Eirlys queuing from 06:30 at the local police
                                station to ensure that when we arrived at 08:00 we first in the queue to ensure
                                that we got our NIE numbers. We both now regard Victor and his staff as friends
                                now and wouldn’t hesitate in recommending them to other property buyers in the
                                future.</strong>							</div>

                            <p>We have stayed for our first holiday in our new holiday home.  Having
                                just retired we have looked forward to this for a long time, and finally
                                we purchased our dream home through Lupain.  Great service,
                                professionality, punctuality and knowledge, but altogether with a good
                                laugh.  Thanks so much for making it so easy.  Janine and Peter</p>							</div>

                            We were very unsure of buying property in Tenerife, but luckily we found
                            Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents and the consultant really listened to what we had to
                            say, and he found us a really great apartment, just met our needs.  The
                            after sales service was very good and helpful, and we felt very
                            supported and confident about it all the way through.   Mary and Kevin

                                of weeks. You went beyond all expectation of the traditional Estate

                                explained. If i ever need to buy or sell another house even out of the
                                Los Cristianos area you will be my contact. All the agents seem asleep

                            We were looking into buying a
                            property in Tenerife and found Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents website through a
                            Google search. We then decided to come along on one of the inspection
                            visits offered by Lupain Tenerife Estate Agents. The inspection visit service was
                            great we had time to discuss the options available and had pre-arranged
                            viewings of properties that suited us. 							</div>

                            Since I started renting the apartment out in May, apart from about 4
                            weeks, I will have had full occupancy until beginning of Dec. It is also
                            fully booked between mid Jan until end of Mar 07 and also for several
                            other weeks already in 2007. I'm also getting repeat business which is
                            nice! I think the trick was to get it decorated and refurbished, and
                            charge realistic prices (200 per week). I have also done it with just
                            minimal advertising (in a magazine designed to attract the newly
                            retired!) and with work colleagues/friends. Fred has also proved to be a
                            good find (although he hasn't actually provided any clients) but he has
                            been very helpful and reliable and again I would recommend him if you
                            have clients in a similar boat to me. Ian the builder is also a top
                            bloke and has done several other jobs for me on the property.

                            Anyway Ian, I just wanted to say thanks for help, I'm next out in Aug so
                            if you feel like a beer let me know! I hope everything is going well
                            with you and that you are not having to work too hard!!							</div>

                            <p>Victor at Lupain was immensely patient with my wife and myself on our
                                inspection visits to the island.
                                His advice was thoughtful and frank and without his assistance I doubt
                                that we would have found a home with which we would be so happy as we
                                are now.</p>							</div>

                            <p>The team was great from the very beginning. They were super responsive on email when I had to reschedule twice. The move to Tenerife was very seamless with a team of two. They were friendly and were able to adhere to our strict requirements during the purchase of the property. Would definitely use them again for sure!</p>							</div>
